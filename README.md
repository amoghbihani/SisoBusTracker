# SisoBusTracker
This application helps track Siso bus location in real time.
It is crowd source location tracking. All the users who are inside the bus can share their locartion which is then share to users who are waiting for the bus.

The app has two options: Waiting and Inside.
When the user is "waiting", he will get the bus location, if available, and when user is "inside", his location would be shared with others who are "waiting".

This application uses Facebook Parse as cloud backend for storing and sharing bus location.
